# reviews-carousel
A carousel app that uses John Smilga's tutorial as its base. Uses code from https://github.com/john-smilga/javascript-basic-projects and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=2644s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org This is the first project I made with vanilla javascript so its purpose was mostly to get me familiar with javascript syntax and best practices.
